Wanting to get your hands on AFL game logs to run your own analysis? We've opened up access to our database and for a small fee of $10 you can download player game logs from the start of the 2021 season onwards. Stats will be downloaded in a simple csv format, example of output shown below. 

$10 gives you access to the database for one calendar year (until December 31st 2022). 

Stats are updated each week at the completion of each round.
