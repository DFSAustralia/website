      <description>What is Value? A popular way to try normalise player performance in the Fantasy Sports community is to define it in terms of a multiple of their salary. For example, if Tom Mitchell is priced at $15,000 and scores 105 fantasy points then heâ€™s deemed to have returned 7.00x his salary, e.g. (105 / 15,000) * 1000 = 7.00x.
 This common strategy gives coaches the ability to compare players across a range of salaries and make a decision on who they think is the best value play for their lineup.</description>
