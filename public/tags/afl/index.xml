      <description>If you are serious about your DFS you’ve probably considered building your own Lineup Optimiser (or Cruncher) at some point. After learning that Excel isn’t the greatest tool for this you’ve probably spent 10 minutes or so googling how to build one and decided that it’s way too complicated and decided you’ll stick with the free to use options that are available. Resigned to the fact that personalised optimisers are only for those people with advanced coding skills.</description>

      <title>Can You Be Profitable Playing AFL DFS?</title>

      <description>I’m confident in saying that 99% of people who read this blog post have at some point dreamt of turning their AFL DFS hobby into a full time income stream. How practical though is that dream in the current landscape? Draftkings and Fanduel offer up eye-watering prizes for those playing US sports but AFL tournaments on Draftstars rarely offer up more than $75,000 prize pools with first place usually taking home less than $10,000.</description>

      <description>Defence v Position Defence vs Position (or DVP) is a common tool used throughout the Fantasy Sports Industry. The tool has varying levels of importance depending on which sport you are playing. Sports like NBA or NFL lend themselves very well to DVP as there are specific one-on-one matchups that are predictable from one game to the next and player’s roles are highly consistent.</description>

      <title>Defining Draftstars Player Value</title>
      <link>/blog/2020/08/11/defining-draftstars-player-value/</link>

      <description>What is Value? A popular way to try normalise player performance in the Fantasy Sports community is to define it in terms of a multiple of their salary. For example, if Tom Mitchell is priced at $15,000 and scores 105 fantasy points then he’s deemed to have returned 7.00x his salary, e.g. (105 / 15,000) * 1000 = 7.00x.
This common strategy gives coaches the ability to compare players across a range of salaries and make a decision on who they think is the best value play for their lineup.</description>
