<p>To analyse your performance using this Profit Tracker you need to download your history file (in csv format) direct from Draftstars. This can then be uploaded into the tool and your results will be broken down for you to review. The maximum file size that can be uploaded into the application is 20MB.</p>
<p>Its recommended that you do not modify the csv file before uploading, the application may not be able to successfully read the data if columns have been modified. Deletion of rows shouldnâ€™t have an affect but empty rows should be avoided.</p>
<p>Note for the privacy of our users this application does not store any information that is uploaded.</p>
