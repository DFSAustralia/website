<p>The AFLW season has kicked off for 2022 and people are starting to get interested in AFLW Fantasy. Moreira’s Magic have released a great product that everyone should be getting behind <a href="https://aflwfantasy.com.au/" target="_blank">aflwfantasy.com.au</a>.</p>
<p>We don’t envisage providing data tools at this stage but to do our little part in building this community we’ve collated the advanced stats for Round 1 of the AFLW season and made them downloadable <a href="/data/blog%20-%20AFLW%20Extended%20Stats%20Round%201/Extended%20ALFW%20Stats%20Round%201.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p>The stats available include ruck contests attended, centre bounce attendances (CBAs), kickins taken and played on from, etc.</p>
<p>Head back over after the completion of each round and download updated data (if we don’t get too lazy).</p>
