This application summarises player game performance when a selected teammate has suited up versus when they have not. Where players have been traded mid-season it's recommended that the user give more consideration to the player's specific [game logs](https://www.dfsaustralia.com/nba-player-stats/){target="_blank"} to ensure the trends aren't skewed by performances where the player was no longer rostered by that team.
