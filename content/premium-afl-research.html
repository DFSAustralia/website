<p>To become a successful daily fantasy player it’s important to analyse your own performance but also to dig deep into what your opponents are doing. The best players spend a lot hours analysing their opponents play to get an understanding of how they construct their lineups.</p>
<p>The ability to do this level of research has to date only been accessible to those with the programming knowledge to build their own applications. Here at DFSAustralia we’ve been developing our own research tool over the last 18 months which was the cornerstone of our own development to be a successful player. Now we are sharing this tool with you as a <b>PREMIUM</b> offering.</p>
